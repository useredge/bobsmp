                    <p><span className="boldWrap">Bob's SMP</span> is a Minecraft survival multi-player (SMP) server, that aims to add new content that seems modded, but is 100% pure vanilla. It adds many custom attributes and new experiences to the server <span className="boldWrap"> without ever needing to touch the player's client!</span> (Except for the requirement of Optifine at the moment) This will start out as a <span className="boldWrap"> private event</span>, while simultaneously acting as a long-standing beta for players to enjoy, and for us testers to see what works or not. This is very much an <span className="boldWrap"> ongoing project.</span> It is a huge work in progress, but we have <span className="boldWrap">high standards and a clear vision</span> as to what we want this server to become. With your help and generous donations, we will create entirely new and refreshing gameplay for Minecraft!</p>
